# I used VBA CODE to IMPROVE DAILY TASKS 

This repository contains Two cases, where I used VBA code to make daily tasks easier to my coworkers.



## Used By

This project is used by the following companies:

- DISTRIBUIDORA GIOVANNY MORENO CORDOVA. (GMC)



## Why I used it?
- A coworker of mine wasn't pleased with doing repetitive tasks such as fill a cleaning report and record daily temperatures of our warehouses.
- He asked for my help to see If I could come up with an idea of reducing the time and errors from using paper and pencil to complete these daily activities.
- After considering SQL, ACESS, And microsoft to create a mini database I opt to use excel because we already have knowledge on it and creating the database there would be more easy.


## DAILY CLEANING REPORT SCREENSHOTS
- IMPORTANT NOTES
- For privacy issues, I crossed the name of the person in charge of the cleaning duty and the person in charge of checking that everything is in order.
### DAILY CLEANING REPORT SAMPLE SHEET 

- The excel sheet contains a button labeled as "INGRESO DE DATOS" (DATA ENTRY).
- On the first rows it states all the areas covered by the janitor and the Month to be filled manually.
- The rest of the rows contain the materials used to clean the areas, the persons in charge, the status of the report(satisfied or unsatisfied), date and time.

### DAILY CLEANING REPORT PRINT SAMPLE

- The sheet has been layout to be prepared for printing as shown in the second screenshot.
- The button is not shown, logos are displayed and at the bottom there is a space to be signed by the janitor and the supervisor.

### DAILY CLEANING REPORT WITH USERFORM PANEL

- Once I click the button, a panel appears. It is my first design, and I put numbers to guide the user through all the process.

### DAILY CLEANING REPORT WITH CALENDAR
- Once I click a button labeled "INGRESAR CON FECHA ACTUAL", the present date is recorded with the spaces the janitor checked and if everything is checked the report will be labeled as satisfied.

### DAILY CLEANING REPORT MESSAGES
- One of many messages is displayed if I do certain action. In this case I didn't selected a date so the message "SELECCIONE LA FECHA POR FAVOR"(SELECT THE DATE PLEASE).


## DAILY TEMPERATURE CONTROL REPORT SCREENSHOTS

### DAILY TEMPERATURE CONTROL REPORT SAMPLE SHEET 

- The sheets contains the are where temperature and humidity data must be entered.
- The person must fill the data row by row.

### DAILY TEMPERATURE CONTROL REPORT PRINT SAMPLE

- The button is hidden, and the layout is still a work in progress to be more visual appealing to the final user.

### DAILY TEMPERATURE CONTROL PANEL TO CHOOSE THE TIME AND THEN THE DATE

- The 1st userform panel contains three buttons to select the time and then the date.

### DAILY TEMPERATURE CONTROL PANELS TO ENTER THE DATA
- The panels will be erased once the next button is clicked and it goes in the same order as it is stated in the excel sheet, from left to right.

### NOTIFICATIONS ONCE AN ACTION IS DONE
- If there isn't any problem related to the right temperature or humidity, the message would be "Registro Guardado con Ã©xito"(RECORD SAVED SUCCESSFULLY). 
- Otherwise, different messages will appear.
